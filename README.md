## React.ts with Tailwind css

Here's how this works, you input the bill amount, your part of the bill as well as your friend's part. Then you choose who's paying for the whole bill. The application then keeps track of how much do you owe your friends and vice versa.

This is a project built for educational purposes originally in javascript and pure css. and this is a newer version of it using typescript and tailwind css.
